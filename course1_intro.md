  <h2>LSE Course 1 Assignment</h2>
  <div class="content">
    In 2025 I returned to education with the London School of Economics and Political Science Career Accelerator programme in Data Analytics.<br>
    Course 1 "Data Analytics for Business" provided a combination of familiarity and challenge.<br><br>
    Summary of the course modules:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Applying structured thinking – using frameworks such as "Five Whys" to formulate business problems and inform the approach</li>
      <li>MS Excel – An old friend, which I have been using in business for more than 20 years. I learned some new functions that I had not used previously but I was within my comfort zone in this module</li>
      <li>Tableau – Learning a very powerful visual analytics platform for the first time. I explored, analysed and shared data through interactive dashboards and charts as my learning curve steepened</li>
      <li>PostgreSQL – I have supported applications in business with a SQL backend for many years and had a reasonable foundation. That said, this course helped me develop my understanding of database architecture, query writing and best practice.</li>
    </ul>
