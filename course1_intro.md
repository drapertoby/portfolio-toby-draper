In 2025 I returned to education with the London School of Economics and Political Science Career Accelerator programme in Data Analytics.
Course 1 "Data Analytics for Business" provided a combination of familiarity and challenge.

Summary of the course modules:

1. Applying structured thinking – using frameworks such as "Five Ways" to formulate business problems and inform the approach  
2. MS Excel – An old friend, which I have been using in business for more than 20 years. I learned some new functions that I had not used previously but I was within my comfort zone in this module  
3. Tableau – Learning a very powerful visual analytics platform for the first time. I explored, analysed and shared data through interactive dashboards and charts as my learning curve steepened  
4. PostgreSQL – I have supported applications in business with a SQL backend for many years and had a reasonable foundation. That said, this course really helped me to understand database architecture, query writing and best practice for the first time
