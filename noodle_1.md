  <h1>Noodle 1 - Transforming The Data</h1>
  <p>
   Stage 1 is to transform 6 .fit files taken from the workout "Aerobic Recovery" devised by my coach, Scout. This workout was completed between December 2023 and July 2025 when my fitness levels varied.
    After wrangling the data in Python using the fitparse library, I create a .csv file containing the concatinated data in a table format of rows and columns that is ready for further analysis.
