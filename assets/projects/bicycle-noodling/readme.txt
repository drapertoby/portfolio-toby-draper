Project: Bicycle Noodling - Noodle 1: Transforming the data
Author: Toby Draper


Description:
This folder contains two files related to my exploration of data downloaded from TrainerRoad

Files:
1. 1_fit_file_transform.ipynb
   - A Jupyter Notebook containing code and markdown.
   - Performs the initial transformation of six .fit files into one .csv file consisting of a header, rows and columns
   - To run: open in JupyterLab or VS Code, execute cells sequentially
   - Markdown notes and inline comments guide analysts through execution and expected results

2. aerobic_recovery.csv
   - A CSV file generated by the notebook.
   - Contains cleaned workout data from six .fit files transformed into one readable file with a header, rows and columns
   - Created during final execution of the notebook, or usable independently for further wrangling and analysis

Usage:
- Ensure Python and Jupyter are installed.
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, datetime, fitparse

Notes:
- The notebook can be amended with the names of alternative .fit files for processing
