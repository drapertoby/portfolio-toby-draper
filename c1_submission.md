  <h1>Assignment 1: Retail Marketing Analysis</h1>

 <div class="about-content">
        <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>You are a data analyst working with 2Market, a global supermarket which sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour.</p>

    <h2>Problem statement</h2>

<p>Previous marketing campaigns generated engagement from a low proportion of registered 2Market customers. This has negatively impacted how soon customers return to make purchases.
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>Attract customers to return and make purchases sooner by leveraging data-driven marketing campaigns that offer compelling discounts.</p>

<h2>Tools and data</h2>

<p>MS Excel, PostgreSQL, Tableau</p>
<p>Project data consisted of 2 .csv files containing > 2200 rows of data. They described customer demographics, purchasing behaviour (spend, discount, recency) and response to campaigns.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Data was cleaned in Excel, removed outliers, corrected invalid categorical entries and standardised inconsistent date formats across the dataset.</li>
    <li>Imported to PostgreSQL and Tableau, left join on ID field</li>
    <li>All visualisations created in Tableau</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Insights</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Relationship identified between social media engagement, deals and recency</li>
    <li>Generally, customers are not leveraging deals via campaigns. Recency is very high</li>
    <li>High recency likely to negatively impact revenue</li>
    <li>Customers in high income bracket very responsive to social media campaigns</li>
    <li>Recency significantly lower for this group</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Increase granularity of product types. Example, create product sub-types to improve ability to identify potential offers</li>
    <li>Phase out deals not linked to social media campaigns</li>
    <li>Reward social media engagement with deals</li>
    <li>Survey customers to address lack of detail in the data</li>
</ul>
