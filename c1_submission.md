        <h2>Brief</h2>
    <p>You are a data analyst working with 2Market, a global supermarket which sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour.</p>

    <h2>Summary of Approach</h2>

<p>The project involved analysing customer demographics and comparing general patterns with those of a high-income group. I extended this by examining behavioural differences across all available metrics—social media engagement, recency, discount usage, and purchasing choices.
The high-income group displayed commercially valuable traits: shorter time since last visit, selective use of discounts linked to campaigns, and stronger engagement with social media. These behaviours correlated with higher revenue, particularly in alcoholic beverages and meat products.
Based on these insights, I recommended reducing untargeted discounts, incentivising campaign-linked purchases, improving data granularity to refine future targeting, and introducing surveys to address gaps in the data. The goal was to encourage broader customer adoption of the high-income group’s habits.

    <li>The assignment was intended to showcase skills in MS Excel, PostgreSQL and Tableau. All of my Excel and SQL exploration are described in the report and then reproduced using the dataset uploaded to Tableau to keep visualisations consistent</li>
    <li>The brief asks for a dashboard built in Tableau and for a recorded presentation to communicate insights. To simplify delivery, my "dashboard" is actually several dashboards that I click through in the manner of a PowerPoint presentation to tell my story</li>
