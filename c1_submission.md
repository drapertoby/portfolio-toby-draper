    <u>Overview</u><br><br>
    Course 1 consisted of six modules, each one culminating with an Assignment Activity. Students could use these as a basis for their entire submission or ignore them and go their own way in order to meet the brief. I took a third way of using the activities to give my project a basic structure and as a launching point for my exploration.<br><br>

    <u>Brief</u><br><br>
    You are a data analyst working with 2Market, a global supermarket which sells products online and in-store, to help them understand their customer purchase behaviour.<br><br>

    In particular, 2Market wants to understand:
    <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
      <li>The demographics of their customers</li>
      <li>Which advertising channels seem to be the most effective</li>
      <li>Which products seem to sell the best and if that varies based on demographic</li>
    </ul>

    To support 2Market, you’ll:
    <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
      <li>Complete your analysis and create a dashboard: You’ll analyse data and create a dashboard that includes key metrics to inform decision-making (such as the average revenue from each marketing channel.)</li>
      <li>Complete a report: You’ll write a report explaining your approach and any insights discovered.</li>
      <li>Complete your presentation: You’ll communicate insights to stakeholders in a recorded presentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <u>Summary of Observations & Decisions</u><br><br>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
      <li>Assignment Activity #1 directed us to report on the general demographics of customers (age, income, marital status etc). It also directed us to spotlight a subset of customers in a particular high income bracket</li>
      <li>I decided to apply further analysis of the subset of customers in the spotlight from Assignment Activity 1 and found they behaved in a manner that would be desirable for all customers to adopt
        <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
          <li>Less time had elapsed since their previous visit</li>
          <li>They were engaged with social media campaigns</li>
          <li>They tended to leverage discount only via campaigns</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Based on these observations, my recommendations were built around ceasing all discount on purchases unless it was linked to a social media campaign. I predicted that this would influence the shopping behaviour of all customers to adopt the habits of the spotlight subset customers</li>
      <li>The brief asks for a dashboard built in Tableau and for a recorded presentation to communicate insights. To simplify delivery, my "dashboard" is actually several dashboards that I click through in the manner of a PowerPoint presentation to tell my story</li>
    </ul>
