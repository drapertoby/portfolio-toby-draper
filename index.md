      <h2>My name is Toby Draper, welcome to my portfolio</h2>
      <p>I am a storyteller who uses data to solve business problems through compelling, evidence-based narratives. This site showcases that work and the technical skills I am acquiring to support it. It includes projects from the Career Accelerator programme with the London School of Economics and Political Science, where I am currently enrolled. It also features independent, personal projects that transform, explore, and visualise data from sources that interest me.</p>
