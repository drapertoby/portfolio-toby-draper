    <u>Summary of changes</u><br><br>
    <ul style="margin-left: 1rem;">
      <li>State key questions and framework earlier: open the presentation with the specific business questions you’ll answer and explicitly mention the problem-solving framework (do this before maps/visuals). </li>
      <li>Rethink the map: with few countries, consider a different chart type (bar or dot plot) and add relative metrics (per-capita or per-customer) alongside absolutes to account for volume differences. </li>
      <li>Show distributions first: present overall age and income distributions (counts/histograms) before correlation plots (age vs income) so viewers understand group sizes and where bins may be needed. </li>
      <li>Relate demographics more broadly: connect age/income correlations to other variables (education, etc.) and show customer counts per group to judge robustness of results</li>
      <li>Split or reorganize complex slides: consider splitting “ad vs product spend” into two slides for clarity, and avoid repeating the same chart four times—use one chart with a dimension selector/filter instead. </li>
      <li>Increase dashboard filters & reduce repetition: add purposeful filters that enable cross-variable exploration (product → see ads by demographic) instead of repeating near-identical plots. </li>
      <li>Improve chart choices & labelling: where volumes differ, show proportions or per-customer metrics; replace maps or stacked bars where they obscure comparisons; ensure all labels are legible. </li>
</ul>
