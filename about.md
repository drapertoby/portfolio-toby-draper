  <h1>About Me: People-First Data Analytics</h1>
  
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>I am a former Technical Support and Customer Success Leader from BMC Software, with deep expertise in IT Service and Asset Management. My career there provided a strong foundation, but it was my consistent passion for data that defined my path forward.</p>

    <p>I have always been fascinated by how business metrics can tell a story—one that guides service improvements, shapes coaching programmes, and provides clear value to both internal leaders and clients. Presenting this analysis was the aspect of my work I found most rewarding.</p>

    <p>Because I wanted to go even deeper, I enrolled in the London School of Economics "Career Accelerator" in Data Analytics. I have built upon my existing skills in MS Excel and SQL and am now proficient in Tableau, Python, and R. The challenge of mastering these tools has been immensely gratifying.</p>

    <p>I am now seeking a role that sits at the intersection of data and people. My goal is to leverage my analytical skills to solve complex business problems, while applying my extensive experience in stakeholder management to ensure solutions are built on transparency, collaboration, and consensus.</p>
