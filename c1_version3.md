  <div class="about-content">
    <p>I was very happy with the outcome of my version 2 dashboard, which represented clear progression from the version I submitted. I sought advice from a professional Tableau expert who provided the following feedback:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Some of the axis labels are unreadable</li>
      <li>Best practice is for the filters to be applied to all visible charts</li>
      <li>A lot of charts have been crammed in to limited space</li>
          </ul>
<p>In addition to the feedback, I had concluded that version 2 was still built in order to present data to stakeholders. It was not suitable to be used as a working dashboard to track the recommended business objectives. I saw an opportunity to build this solution while making use of the recent feedback.</p>
